Models As Fixtures
-------------------

For testing with Rspec, I have to use some well-formed model files extracted from other sources, namely:

* Annie (not included due to copyright reasons, you can find it within HeroPak_client.zip\DATA\Characters\Annie)

* ogro.md2 (included, copyright info please see Ogro.txt)

If any violation of anyone's copyright is spotted in this project, please contact utensilcandel at Google Mail.

Some models might be included for Rspec testing, for now I'm using LOL's own model for testing, hopefully I can DIY some later...
